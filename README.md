# Optimize a website
As a reminder, the site only appears on the second page of search engines. For it, I improved SEO.

# Steps
1. Analysis of the past state of the SEO website. I have indicated the parts of the sites which are not optimized for SEO and/or which are not up to date in terms of accessibility, and I justified my choice. And I added the good practice to put in place for each part of the site that is not optimized
2. Improved site SEO, site optimization and I provided the complete source code of the improved version of the site.
3. Comparison of results. The loading speed of the pages of the site has an impact on ranking in search results. I took steps to speed up the speed of loading.

# Specification
The site is suitable for all screen sizes
